# Murphy-Lab-LI-Graphs
Code to analyze and graph chemotaxis data

Set Up:
    For this code you will need to have pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn installed
    Install commands:
        pip install pandas
        pip install matplotlib
        pip install seaborn

    If there is a problem with pandas you may need to downgrade your numpy with the command:
        pip install numpy==1.26.4  pyyaml

    The error is occuring due to incompatable versions of numpy and pandas
